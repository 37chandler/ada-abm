# Agent-Based Models

As the lectures describe, agent-based models (ABMs) are a useful way to model emergent phenomenon. In this exercise we build off the excellent [blog post](http://adilmoujahid.com/posts/2020/05/streamlit-python-schelling/) by Adil Moujahid, looking at segregation through the lens of ABMs. This is only an exercise, but you're asked to explore some of the parameters and play around with the code. 

This code is also written in an object oriented style, which isn't something I've done very often in the course, so you might learn a bit about classes along the way.
